      <blockquote>Rusilah Gojali! A California native, mother of three boys, juggling the cyber world with the family world! I have this passion for coding because I see coding as an epitome of me; it's detail-oriented, complex, and most importantly, fun! Seeing how coding is found in almost every aspect of our lives, coding has allowed me to express myself in an ever-advancing technological world.</blockquote>
